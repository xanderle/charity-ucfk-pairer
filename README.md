## Todo:

- Add a facility to read in previous pairings and not pair those people together again
- Integrate Maven/Gradle for dependencies (currently just have the folder in the same directory)
- Get time to travel from Google API's (available pairings is potentially below the 2500 daily limit threshold, so might be doable! Maybe get the lowest distances for people?)
- Save draft emails to send out (wishlist)
- GUI (wishlist)

- Clean up any spotty code
